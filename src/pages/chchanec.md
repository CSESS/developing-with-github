Dear Future Samuel on the Podium,

# I am CHAN, Chun Hin (Vincent) from HKUST CSE. I am Year 3 and I have took Professor Desmond's COMP2012 and COMP2211. 
# He teaches both courses very good!!!

Also, I think Samuel can include the instruction manual for Windows user. :)

## Doing this seminar and everything live must be really stressful.
### But I do hope both the audience and you can take home something. :)

Keep it on Samuel!

Best,
Vincent Chan
